In today's digital age, the retail and commerce landscape has transformed significantly, largely due to the rise of e-commerce platforms. With the convenience of online shopping, consumers now have unparalleled access to a vast array of products and services from the comfort of their homes.

**Dataset**

**_Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Oldest_**

**Olist** is a Brazilian startup that operates in the retail technology segment. The company has solutions that facilitate the management of offline and online stores (_e-commerce_) and also a sales acceleration solution within _marketplaces_. It was founded in 2015 by Tiago Dalvi.

The dataset has information on 100k orders from 2016 to 2018 made at multiple marketplaces in Brazil. Its features allow viewing orders from multiple dimensions: from order status, price, payment and freight performance to customer location, product attributes and, customer reviews. The Olist dataset can be found and downloaded using this link on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce).

**Data Preparation**

In this stage, I concentrate on preparing the data for analysis. This involves importing the data and creating an ER diagram to visually show the relationship between the various tables and how they are connected. Extra columns were added to some tables and, empty spaces and null values were also updated.

**Data Analysis**
